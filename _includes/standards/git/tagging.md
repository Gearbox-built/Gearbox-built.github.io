### Tagging and Releasing

Versioned libraries, both internal and public, should follow these practices:

* Use a `major_feature.minor_feature/major_bugfix.minor_bugfix` numbering scheme
* Remember to update documentation and version constants
* Always create and push a tag with the version number, prefixed with a `v`
