### Editor preferences

Set your editor to the following settings to avoid common code inconsistencies and dirty diffs:

* Use soft-tabs set to two spaces.
* Trim trailing white space on save.
* Set encoding to UTF-8.
* Add new line at end of files.

Consider documenting and applying these preferences to your project's `.editorconfig` file. For an example, see [the one in Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/master/.editorconfig). Learn more [about EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org).
