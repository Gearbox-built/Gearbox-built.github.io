### An Introduction to Shopify

Shopify is the only platform that we develop for that uses Liquid. Fortunately, they've done a great job on [documentation](http://docs.shopify.com/themes) and almost all of the info that you need can be found there.

* [Basics](http://docs.shopify.com/themes/liquid-documentation/basics)
* [Tags](http://docs.shopify.com/themes/liquid-documentation/tags)
* [Objects](http://docs.shopify.com/themes/liquid-documentation/objects)
* [Filters](http://docs.shopify.com/themes/liquid-documentation/filters)

The **Objects** link above is almost certainly the most important resource available to you when writing code for Shopify. It contains every single object you might come across during development and all of the values attached to them.
