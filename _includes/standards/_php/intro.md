### Introduction

Outside of the WordPress environment, Pixel Union follows PSR-2 standards for PHP development. This is an overview of the higher-level rules for PSR-2, for the full set of standards please reference the [PHP-FIG docs](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/).

the PSR-2 Standard extends the PSR-1 Standard, documented [here](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-1-basic-coding-standard.md).

**Note:** The one way in which we diverge from PSR-2 is that we use 2 spaces for indents instead of 4\. This is to maintain consistency between the other code styles, which are all 2 spaces.
