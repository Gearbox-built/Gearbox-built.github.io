### Control Structures

The general style rules for control structures are as follows:

* One space after the control structure keyword.
* No spaces after the opening parenthesis or before the closing parenthesis.
* One space between the closing parenthesis and the opening brace.
* The structure body should be indented once.
* The closing brace should be on the next line after the body.

The body of each structure should be enclosed by braces. This standardizes how the structures look, and reduces the likelihood of introducing errors as new lines get added to the body.
