### Method and Function Calls

When making a method or function call:

* There should not be a space between the method or function name and the opening parenthesis.
* The only spaces within the parentheses should be between comma-separated arguments.

Argument lists can be split across multiple lines, where each subsequent line is indented once. When doing so, the first item in the list should be on its own line, with only one argument per line.
