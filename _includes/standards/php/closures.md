### Closures

* Closures should be declared with a space after the `function` keyword, and a space before and after the `use` keyword.
* No spaces within the parentheses, except between comma-separated arguments.
* Arguments with default values should go at the end of the argument list.

Like methods and functions, argument lists can be spread across multiple lines, using the same line-break and indentation style.
