### Class names

* Keep classes lowercase and use dashes (not underscores or camelCase). Dashes serve as natural breaks in related class (e.g., `.btn` and `.btn-danger`).
* [Scope CSS classes with prefixes](http://markdotto.com/2012/02/16/scope-css-classes-with-prefixes/).
* Avoid excessive and arbitrary shorthand notation. `.btn` is useful for _button_, but `.s` doesn't mean anything.
* Keep classes as short and succinct as possible.
* Use meaningful names; use structural or purposeful names over presentational.
* Use `.js-*` classes to denote behavior (as opposed to style), but keep these classes out of your CSS.
