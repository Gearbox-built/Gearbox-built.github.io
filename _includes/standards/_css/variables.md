### Variables

Variables in Sass are a powerful way to define values in one place that can be reused in multiple places in your project. They allow you to make changes from a central point without needing to use find and replace across multiple files and directories. [[ref]](http://thesassway.com/beginner/variable-naming)

* Names should be descriptive of purpose or function, not of the value.
* Multi-word variables should be separated by hyphens.
* Keep variables in a centralized file. For our Shopify themes, that's `_user-settings.scss`.
