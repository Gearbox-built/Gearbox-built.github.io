### Syntax

* Use soft tabs with two spaces—they're the only way to guarantee code renders the same in any environment.
* Nested elements should be indented once (two spaces).
* Always use double quotes, never single quotes, on attributes.
* Don't include a trailing slash in self-closing elements—the [HTML5 spec](http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec-author-view/syntax.html#syntax-start-tag) says they're optional.
* Don’t omit optional closing tags (e.g. `</li>` or `<body>`).
