### Naming Conventions

* Use `/** ... */` for multi-line comments. Include a description, specify types and values for all parameters and return values.
* Use `//` for single line comments. Place single line comments on a newline above the subject of the comment. Put an empty line before the comment.

Prefixing your comments with `FIXME` or `TODO` helps other developers quickly understand if you're pointing out a problem that needs to be revisited, or if you're suggesting a solution to the problem that needs to be implemented. These are different than regular comments because they are actionable.

* Use `// FIXME:` to annotate problems.
* Use `// TODO:` to annotate solutions to problems.
