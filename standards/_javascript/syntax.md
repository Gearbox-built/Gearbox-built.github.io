### Syntax

* Use soft tabs with two spacesâ€”they're the only way to guarantee code renders the same in any environment.
* Try your best to limit all lines to a maximum of 80 characters. Do not ever go over 120.
* Do not include trailing whitespace on any lines.
* Use only unix-style newlines. `\n` not `\r\n`.
* Use UTF-8 as the source file encoding.
* Include one space before the opening brace for legibility.
* Include 1 space before the opening parenthesis in control statements. Include no spaces before the argument list in function calls and declarations.
* Set off operators with spaces.
* End files with a single newline character.
* Leave a blank line after blocks and before the next statement.
* Use a single blank line within the bodies of methods or functions in cases where this improves readability.
* Do not use leading commas.
* Use additional trailing commas for cleaner diffs.
* Always use explicit semicolons.
* Use braces with all multi-line blocks.
* If you're using multi-line blocks with if and else, put else on the same line as your if block's closing brace.
