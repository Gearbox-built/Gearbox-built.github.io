### Naming Conventions

* Avoid single letter names. Be descriptive with your naming.
* Use camelCase when naming objects, functions, and instances.
* Use PascalCase when naming constructors or classes.
* Use a leading underscore `_` when naming private properties or methods.
* Don't save references to `this`. Use arrow functions or `Function#bind`.
* If your file exports a single class, your filename should be exactly the name of the class.
* Use camelCase when you export-default a function. Your filename should be identical to your function's name.
