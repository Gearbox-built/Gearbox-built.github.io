### An introduction to Git

At its most basic, source control gives us the ability to store, share, and transport code and code changes, but the real value comes from the ability to record and replay the stories behind each change during the lifetime of a project.

This is _not_ an intro to source control or a git how-to: we assume that you have an intermediate understanding of how to use git. If you’re new to git, chapters 2, 3, and 6 (through the section on interactive rebasing) of Scott Chacon’s [git book](http://git-scm.com/book) will tell you the how.

It doesn’t matter if you use git’s commands or a GUI (see [GitHub for Mac](http://mac.github.com) and [Gitbox](http://gitboxapp.com)), but you need a confident understanding of what’s happening regardless. Knowing the commands often helps.
