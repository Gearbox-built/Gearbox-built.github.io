### Repo Naming

To keep our many repositories easy to find we follow a simple naming convention:

* Names are all lowercase, with hyphens as separators.
* Themes are suffixed by their platform: -shopify, -wp, -tumblr, -ghost.
* Tools are prefixed by their platform: wp-calcium, shopify-skeleton.
* Theme forks for client customizations are named theme-client-platform.
