### Basics

* Use one blank line after the namespace declaration, one blank line after the block of `use` declarations.
* Opening braces for both classes and methods should go on the next line, and closing braces should go on the next line after the body.
* Visibility must be declared on all properties and methods; `abstract` and `final` should be declared before the visibility; `static` should be declared after the visibility.
* Variables and functions should be declared in `snake_case`.
* Class names should be declared in `PascalCase`.
* Method names should be declared in `camelCase`.
* Class constants should be declared in all uppercase with underscore separators.
