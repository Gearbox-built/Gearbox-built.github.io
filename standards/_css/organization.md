### Organization

Thanks to compilation and compression, we're able to organize styles into many small files without impacting the end user. Rules should be organized into small sets corresponding to the elements they style. Styles of unrelated elements should never be in the same file.

* Organize sections of code by component.
* Develop a consistent commenting hierarchy.
