### Nesting

Nesting is very helpful to define element states such as active and hover, pseudo elements like before and after, and minimal child selectors that don't justify an additional class name.

* Avoid unnecessary nesting. Just because you can nest, doesn't mean you always should.
* At a maximum, nesting should only go three levels deep.
* Maximum amount of nested lines is 60\. Your entire nest should be visible on a laptop's screen.
