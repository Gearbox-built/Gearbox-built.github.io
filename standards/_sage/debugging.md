### Debugging

* Blade templates are cached so it is recommended to download and install [blade-generate](https://github.com/alwaysblank/blade-generate), a WP-CLI package that can be used to compile, wipe, and clear Blade templates.
* For basic PHP debugging, install the [Kint debugger](https://wordpress.org/plugins/kint-debugger/) plugin to cleanly output information about variables and traces.
* For advanced debugging set up your local environment with [xDebug](https://xdebug.org/)
